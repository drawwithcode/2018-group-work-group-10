## AIM OF PROJECT
This project is to make people experience the haze and be aware of Â the harm of air pollution around the world. 
Users will experience the feeling of staying in the environment of heavy air pollution and try to see the landscape of the city clearly

       * Mouse; Sub interactions such as swiping to next city.

### HOW IT WORKS?
Firstly, the user clicks the city that s/he wants to explore. Then, the user starts to experience how haze effects cities. They try to clear their vision with interacting with webcam because they can barely see the city. After cleaning process, they get specific information about related city and its haze problem. There is next and back button in every page to finish or continue the experience. When the user finishes to experience of every city, they end up with more to read and your location page. In this page user can read more about haze and air pollution. On the other hand, they can learn the percentage of haze and air pollution in their city.

* The graphical style is illustration which is drawn by hand. 
  * In drawings, there are most important city landmarks such as Taj Mahal in Delhi. 
  * The colors of drawings are based on the color of country and city.

* In different cities, color of the hazes are different to highlight the different pollution reasons and outcomes such as CO, PM2.5, PM10
