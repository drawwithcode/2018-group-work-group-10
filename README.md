## AIM OF PROJECT
This project is to make people experience the haze and be aware of Â the harm of air pollution around the world. 
Users will experience the feeling of staying in the environment of heavy air pollution and try to see the landscape of the city clearly

## INTERACTIONS
* Hazy World combines two different interaction with its users. They are waving hands and clicking by mouse.
  * WebCam; Main interactions such as cleaning the haze
  * Mouse; Sub interactions such as swiping to next city.

### HOW IT WORKS?

      
Firstly, the user clicks the city that s/he wants to explore. Then, the user starts to experience how haze effects cities. They try to clear their vision with interacting with webcam because they can barely see the city. After cleaning process, they get specific information about related city and its haze problem. There is next and back button in every page to finish or continue the experience. When the user finishes to experience of every city, they end up with more to read and your location page. In this page user can read more about haze and air pollution. On the other hand, they can learn the percentage of haze and air pollution in their city.  

### DETAILS

  * **gest.min.js** is the main library to obtain human gestures and to clean actions.
  * **p5.geolocation** is used to get the location of users and direct them to learn air pollution rates at their location.
